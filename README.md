# Multinational-retail-data-centralisation

# Project description

The aim of this project is to use various Python cloud tools and data extractors (such as Boto3, SQLAlchemy, tabular-py, json) to make my own OOP-based Python package for extracting and cleaning data and having the option to upload to a cloud database. I have achieved this aims and made a Python package with tools that can perform these tasks.



## Installation instructions

Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/Qwandy/multinational-retail-data-centralisation`. This will give you access to the code. You should familiarise yourself with the methods in the python file if you wish to explore and use them in your own code. 'data_cleaning.py' contains the DataCleaning class, 'data_extraction.py' contains the DataExtractor class and 'database_utils.py' contains the DatabaseConnector class. You can import these py files to your own code to use the methods within the classes.
